# Kata Workflow

This document explains how work moves through Kata, from a miner pull request to
a new king, and how engine contributors should change the system safely.

Kata has two contributor paths:

- **Miner contributors** submit one candidate agent under `submissions/`.
- **Engine contributors** change the competition engine, docs, lane tooling, or
  evaluator integration.

For the exact miner bundle contract, see [submissions.md](submissions.md).

## System Roles

- `kata` is the engine. It validates submissions, runs screening and duels,
  records provenance, and promotes winners.
- `kata-bot` is the GitHub automation layer. It receives PR events, queues jobs,
  calls Kata commands, comments on PRs, closes losers, and merges winners.
- `kata-board` is the dashboard. It reads live status, lane state, run artifacts,
  and PR history.
- `sandbox` is the pinned SN60 Bitsec evaluator mirror. Kata reads and executes
  against it, but Kata changes must not modify upstream subnet code.

## Miner Submission Lifecycle

1. **Create a branch.** The miner works in the public Kata repo on a normal GitHub
   branch.
2. **Add one bundle.** The PR adds exactly one directory under
   `submissions/<subnet-pack>/<mode>/<submission-id>/`.
3. **Validate locally.** The miner runs `kata submission validate` before opening
   the PR.
4. **Open PR.** The PR targets the default competition branch and only touches
   the submission bundle.
5. **Queue.** `kata-bot` receives the webhook and stores a durable queue job keyed
   by repo, PR number, and head SHA.
6. **Inspect.** Before trusting PR contents, the bot checks changed paths and
   rejects off-scope edits.
7. **Evaluate.** Kata evaluates the candidate against the current king.
8. **Decide.** Kata reduces the result to one PR action.
9. **Apply action.** The bot comments, labels, closes, reruns, holds, or merges.
10. **Promote.** A verified winner is published as the new king and lane state is
    updated.

## Evaluation Stages

Kata currently runs the live SN60 Bitsec miner lane: `sn60__bitsec/miner`.

### 1. Validation

Validation checks the candidate bundle before any expensive sandbox work:

- exactly one submission directory
- required files are present
- `agent.py` defines a valid synchronous `agent_main`
- Python sources compile
- the target lane exists and is active
- the bundle is self-contained and within size limits
- obvious secret leakage, benchmark-answer leakage, and sampling overrides are
  rejected

### 2. Screening

Screening is the cheap reject gate:

- static SN60 checks
- one candidate sandbox execution
- no king run

Static screening rejects obvious cost-wasters before the sandbox starts:

- helper files in SN60 V1 bundles
- hardcoded provider keys or validator secret env references
- benchmark-answer leakage indicators
- async or non-callable `agent_main`
- direct no-op returns such as `{"vulnerabilities": []}`

Execution screening then requires one valid Bitsec-style report:

- sandbox execution must complete successfully within the validator screening
  timeout
- report must contain a top-level `vulnerabilities` list
- the list must contain at least one candidate finding
- each finding must include a title and useful description
- optional severity must be `critical`, `high`, `medium`, or `low`
- reports are capped at 100 findings

Empty screening reports are rejected as no-op submissions. Agents should not
catch inference/API failures and return `{"vulnerabilities": []}` as a fallback.

If screening fails, the PR is closed with the screening reason and the full duel
is skipped.

Production validators should keep screening cheap. The recommended MVP timeout
is:

```bash
KATA_SN60_SCREENING_EXECUTION_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=300
```

This timeout only applies to the one screening sandbox execution. Full duel
executions keep the normal SN60 execution timeout.

### 3. Duel

If screening passes, Kata runs a king-vs-candidate duel.

Default production behavior:

- all projects from the resolved benchmark snapshot are eligible
- candidate and king run the same selected project set
- each selected project runs once by default, matching the SN60 job-run style
- execution is per project: candidate first, then king for that same project,
  then the next project
- the sandbox returns SN60 metrics for each project: true positives, total
  expected, detection rate, precision, F1, and PASS/FAIL

MVP cost-saving behavior:

- validators can set `KATA_SN60_PROJECT_SAMPLE_SIZE`
- if the sample size is smaller than the full benchmark,
  `KATA_SN60_PROJECT_SAMPLE_SECRET` is required
- Kata samples a random-looking project subset per evaluation
- the selected keys are recorded in the challenge summary and lane provenance
- `KATA_SN60_PROJECT_KEYS` is an explicit override and should normally remain
  unset for production

Example MVP settings:

```bash
KATA_SN60_PROJECT_KEYS=
KATA_SN60_PROJECT_SAMPLE_SIZE=12
KATA_SN60_PROJECT_SAMPLE_SECRET=<private-validator-secret>
KATA_SN60_REPLICAS_PER_PROJECT=1
KATA_SN60_SCREENING_EXECUTION_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=300
```

### 4. Promotion Gate

A candidate promotes only if all conditions pass:

- screening passed
- candidate strictly beats the king by rank
- the result is fresh against the current king and benchmark state

The rank comparator is:

1. detection score
2. true positives
3. precision
4. F1 score
5. fewer invalid/error evaluations

Same score and same tie-breakers are not enough; the candidate must strictly
beat the current king.

Detection score follows the SN60 scorer signal:
`total_true_positives / total_expected_vulnerabilities`.

Metric meanings:

- `true positives`: benchmark vulnerabilities the agent correctly found.
- `precision`: how many reported findings were real matches,
  `true_positives / total_found`.
- `F1 score`: balance between detection score and precision.
- `invalid/error evaluation`: the sandbox or scorer could not produce a valid
  successful evaluation for that project. It contributes zero metrics and hurts
  tie-breaks.

Sandbox `PASS` still means a project run found all expected vulnerabilities.
PASS project count is useful context, but it is not the primary promotion score.

## PR Decision Actions

Kata returns one action:

- `merge` means the candidate beat the current king and passed freshness checks.
- `close-losing` means the candidate evaluated correctly but did not beat the
  king.
- `close-invalid` means the bundle or PR shape is invalid.
- `rerun-stale` means the king, benchmark, or submission changed during
  evaluation.
- `hold-merge` is used by the bot when GitHub mergeability blocks an otherwise
  winning PR.

## Freshness And Provenance

Every evaluation records enough data to audit the result:

- candidate artifact hash
- king artifact hash
- selected project keys
- benchmark file hash
- sandbox commit
- scorer version
- replica count
- challenge fingerprint

Before merging, Kata verifies that the evaluated candidate still matches the PR,
the king is still current, and the benchmark lane fingerprint has not changed.

## Promotion

When the final action is `merge`, the production bot:

1. labels the PR with the winning lane label
2. merges the PR
3. publishes the candidate bundle under `kings/<subnet-pack>/<mode>/`
4. updates lane king state
5. clears the merged submission directory from `main`

This keeps `submissions/` empty between active PRs while `kings/` remains the
public source of truth for the current best agent.

## Engine Contribution Workflow

Engine contributions should preserve evaluator integrity and provenance.

1. Identify the affected area:
   - submission contract: `kata/submissions.py`, `kata/screening.py`
   - evaluator adapter: `kata/evaluators/`
   - challenge and promotion logic: `kata/challenge.py`
   - lane state schemas: `kata/lane_state.py`
   - docs: `README.md`, `docs/`
2. Add or update tests for behavior changes.
3. Run targeted tests first, then broader tests when practical.
4. Do not weaken validation, screening, freshness, or promotion gates without a
   specific rationale and tests.
5. Do not modify upstream subnet code in `sandbox`.

Recommended local checks:

```bash
uv run pytest -q tests/test_submissions.py tests/test_sn60_challenge.py tests/test_sn60_bitsec.py
uv run --extra dev python -m pytest
