# PromptForge

PromptForge is an objective prompt-optimization repo for SN74/Gittensor.

It evaluates repo-specific agent prompts on pinned benchmark tasks and only
calls a prompt better when it solves more verified work under the same
conditions.

PromptForge is not a prompt library. The main product is the evaluation and
competition system:

- fixed benchmark tasks
- fixed baseline prompt
- current frontier prompt
- challenger prompt evaluation
- objective promotion rules

## What It Does

PromptForge currently supports:

- repo-specific prompt initialization from repo sources
- fixed generic baseline prompts
- eval-pack validation for pinned repo tasks
- objective eval runs using real agent commands
- baseline/frontier/challenger competition flow
- primary and holdout task pools
- manual frontier promotion after a successful challenge

Current MVP boundary:

- it is a working manual competition system
- it is not yet an automated challenger queue
- it is not yet a full prompt-search engine

Prompt generation exists in this repo as a bootstrap helper:

- it can create an initial repo-specific prompt from repo files
- that prompt can seed the first frontier
- it is one source of challengers, not the main product

## Core Idea

A prompt only improves if it performs better on controlled repo tasks:

- same repo snapshot
- same task definition
- same agent command
- same model and budget
- same checks
- prompt is the variable

Prompt quality is measured by task success, path-policy compliance, and any
other behavior encoded directly in the benchmark checks. It is not judged by
wording quality alone.

## Competition Model

PromptForge uses three prompt roles for each repo and mode:

- `baseline`: fixed generic control prompt
- `frontier`: current best verified prompt
- `challenger`: new candidate prompt

Competition flow:

1. initialize a frontier manifest for a repo and mode
2. evaluate `baseline`, `frontier`, and `challenger` on the same primary pool
3. if the challenger beats the frontier, retest on the holdout pool
4. only promote if the challenger also beats the frontier on holdout

The baseline is not the prompt miners should use in production. It is the fixed
control used to prove that repo-specific optimization is adding value.

## Benchmark Provenance

PromptForge now records benchmark provenance alongside eval and challenge
results:

- evaluator version
- prompt hashes
- task ids
- task-pool fingerprints

This matters because a prompt win is only meaningful if it was measured against
the same evaluator and the same benchmark state. See
`docs/evaluator-versioning.md` for the intended model.

PromptForge's proposed benchmark score model is defined in
`docs/SCORING.md`.

## How To Think About The Workflow

PromptForge has two separate jobs:

1. `initialize prompts`
   Create a starting repo-specific prompt and a fixed baseline.
2. `evaluate prompts`
   Compare baseline, frontier, and challenger prompts on the same benchmark.

That is why the repo has both prompt-creation commands and competition
commands.

The simplest mental model is:

- `baseline`: fixed generic control
- `frontier`: current best verified prompt
- `challenger`: new candidate prompt

The usual workflow is:

1. define a benchmark pack
2. initialize a frontier for that repo and mode
3. use `generate` if you want a first repo-specific prompt to seed the frontier
4. challenge the frontier with better candidate prompts
5. promote the challenger if it wins primary and holdout evaluation

## Repository Layout

- `promptforge/`: core package and CLI
- `evals/`: benchmark packs for registered repos
- `scripts/`: adapter commands for real agent evaluation
- `tests/`: regression tests for evaluator behavior

Tracked benchmark artifacts may also include:

- `frontier.json`: repo competition manifest
- `prompts/<mode>/baseline.md`
- `prompts/<mode>/frontier.md`

Generated eval runs are written to `runs/` and are ignored by git.

## Benchmark State

This branch does not currently ship a tracked live benchmark pack under
`evals/`.

To run PromptForge end to end, you should first create or add a repo-specific
eval pack, then initialize a frontier for it.

At minimum, that means:

- one repo-specific task directory under `evals/`
- valid benchmark task files
- a frontier manifest created with `promptforge frontier init`

## Quickstart

Generate a repo-specific prompt for initialization or as a challenger starting
point:

```bash
uv run python -m promptforge generate \
  --repo /path/to/target-repo \
  --mode contributor
```

Generate the fixed baseline prompt:

```bash
uv run python -m promptforge baseline \
  --repo /path/to/target-repo \
  --mode contributor
```

Validate the benchmark pack:

```bash
uv run python -m promptforge eval-pack validate \
  --path evals/<repo-pack>
```

Run a baseline-vs-generated eval:

```bash
uv run python -m promptforge eval \
  --repo /path/to/target-repo \
  --eval-pack evals/<repo-pack> \
  --mode contributor \
  --agent-command "$PWD/scripts/run_codex_eval.sh"
```

Render an eval report:

```bash
uv run python -m promptforge report --run <run-id>
```

## Frontier Workflow

Initialize a frontier manifest:

```bash
uv run python -m promptforge frontier init \
  --repo /path/to/target-repo \
  --eval-pack evals/<repo-pack> \
  --mode contributor \
  --primary-task task-a \
  --primary-task task-b \
  --holdout-task task-c
```

Inspect the current frontier:

```bash
uv run python -m promptforge frontier show \
  --eval-pack evals/<repo-pack> \
  --mode contributor
```

Challenge the frontier:

```bash
uv run python -m promptforge challenge \
  --eval-pack evals/<repo-pack> \
  --mode contributor \
  --candidate-prompt path/to/candidate.md \
  --agent-command "$PWD/scripts/run_codex_eval.sh"
```

Promote a winning challenger:

```bash
uv run python -m promptforge frontier promote \
  --challenge-run runs/<challenge-run>/challenge_summary.json
```

## Real Agent Commands

This repo includes two adapter scripts:

- `scripts/run_codex_eval.sh`
- `scripts/run_claude_eval.sh`

Optional model overrides:

```bash
PROMPTFORGE_CODEX_MODEL=o3 uv run python -m promptforge eval ...
PROMPTFORGE_CLAUDE_MODEL=sonnet uv run python -m promptforge eval ...
```

These adapters assume the corresponding CLI is already installed and
authenticated.

## Open-Source Status

PromptForge is ready to be public as a framework-level MVP.

What is already solid:

- the core objective-eval design
- benchmark-pack validation
- stricter report and path-policy handling
- frontier challenge workflow
- evaluator-version and benchmark-provenance recording
- prompt initialization for seeding a frontier
- regression tests for evaluator behavior

What is still planned:

- checked-in public benchmark packs
- automated challenger submission and queueing
- automated promotion policy
- larger benchmark coverage
- stronger reviewer-mode examples
- prompt-search automation beyond manual challenger prompts
- stronger maintainer-owned evaluator protection

## Development

Run the current checks:

```bash
uv run pytest
uv run ruff check
```
