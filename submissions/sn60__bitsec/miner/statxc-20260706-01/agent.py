"""SN60 / Bitsec miner agent: keyword-ranked triage + multi-pass LLM review,
with cheap cross-file context and similarity-based dedup.

Walks the mounted project for smart-contract source files, ranks them by how
suspicious they look (payable functions, external calls, access-control
keywords, ...), then runs each top-ranked file through several narrowly
focused specialist passes (access control, fund-flow accounting, unit/
interface mismatches, math/iteration edge cases) instead of one generic
"find bugs" prompt. Each file is scanned together with a small amount of
cheap, regex-resolved cross-file context (imported/inherited files) so a bug
that only shows up when a base contract and its child are read together is
not missed. Passes run concurrently against the single pinned inference
endpoint under a hard wall-clock budget, so a slow or hung file cannot starve
the rest of the run, and a transient request failure gets one retry before
being counted as a loss.

This agent intentionally does NOT replicate a full agentic router/recon/LLM-
merge pipeline. Cross-file linking and de-duplication are done with cheap,
local regex/set-similarity logic instead of extra model calls, so the whole
design stays a single self-contained, stdlib-only file with a small, bounded
number of inference calls per project.

_COMMON_TAIL = f"""
Only report a finding if you can state the exact function name and a
concrete scenario (inputs, call sequence, or numeric example) that shows
the impact. If you cannot show a concrete path, do not report it.

Name the exact source file (with its extension, e.g. "StakingManager.sol")
and the exact function (written as `functionName(...)`) directly in the
title or description text -- in addition to, not instead of, the "function"
field below.

Do not report:
- functions already gated by onlyOwner/onlyRole/similar modifiers, unless
  you can show the role check itself is bypassable
- decimal/scaling differences that are already handled by an explicit
  conversion helper in the code
- reentrancy, unless you can point to a state write that happens AFTER an
  external call, with no reentrancy guard, and a concrete profit path
- gas/DoS from unbounded loops, unless the loop bound is attacker-controlled
  with no practical cap
- unchecked return values on calls that revert by default or use a safe
  transfer wrapper

Only report severity "high" or "critical", and only when your own
confidence in the finding is at least 0.7.

Respond with ONLY a JSON array (no prose, no markdown fences), at most
{MAX_FINDINGS_PER_CALL} elements, each an object with keys: "title",
"description" (at least two sentences explaining the concrete exploit
path), "severity" ("high" or "critical"), "function", "line" (integer or
null), "confidence" (0-1 float), "recommendation". If nothing meets this
bar, respond with an empty JSON array: [].

You are a skeptical senior smart-contract security reviewer. You will be

Your job is to challenge the finding, not confirm it by default.

Check specifically:

- Does the code actually behave as described? Re-read the relevant lines
  directly rather than trusting the summary.
- Is there a guard, check, or invariant elsewhere in the file that the
  original finding missed and that prevents the claimed impact?
- Is the claimed impact concrete and reachable, or vague/speculative?

"confidence" always means how confident you are that the ORIGINAL FINDING
describes a real, exploitable vulnerability -- 0.0 means definitely not
real, 1.0 means definitely real. It is never your confidence in the verdict
label itself: a "refuted" verdict should carry a LOW confidence (the finding
is probably not real), not a high one.

Lower the confidence if the original claim is wrong, exaggerated, or already
handled elsewhere in the code. Raise it only if you can point to the exact
lines that prove the issue is real and reachable. When in doubt, lean
toward a lower confidence rather than a higher one.
